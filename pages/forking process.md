- What
	- Forking is an operating system operation where the current process (the parent) creates a duplicate of itself (the child). In Unix-like systems, this is done using the fork() system call. The child process gets an exact copy of the parentâ€™s memory space at the time of forking, but both processes will continue to run independently after the fork.
